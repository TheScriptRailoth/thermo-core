# ThermoCore

## Description

**ThermoCore** is a cutting-edge Windows application built using Flutter, designed to enable intuitive modeling and simulation of complex thermodynamic cycles. Targeted at engineers, researchers, and educators, ThermoCore provides a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing energy systems with a focus on the Rankine cycle.

## Features

- **Interactive Design:** User-friendly drag and drop interface to arrange and connect components such as turbines, boilers, condensers, and pumps.
- **Simulation Capabilities:** Perform dynamic simulations with updates on thermodynamic properties like pressure and temperature in real time.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows users to set specific parameters for each component to tailor simulations to particular requirements.
- **Graphical Outputs:** Offers graphical representations of thermodynamic cycles, enhancing understanding of system behaviors under various operational conditions.
